I developed a Random Password Generator Web Application that allows users to generate secure passwords based on their input. The application takes a user-defined set of four letters and incorporates them into a 10-character password, ensuring that the specified letters occupy designated positions. This project emphasizes user experience and security by providing a straightforward interface for password creation.

Key Features:
-- Password Structure: The application ensures that the first letter is at the first position, the second at the third position, the third at the fifth position, and the fourth at the seventh position, while random characters fill the remaining positions.
-- Real-Time Password Generation: Passwords are generated instantly upon submission, enhancing user convenience.
-- Input Validation: The app validates user input to ensure exactly four letters are provided, improving reliability and usability.
-- User-Friendly Interface: Users can easily input four letters into a single input box and get Password instantly without much complexity!.

Technologies Used:

> HTML: For structuring the web application.
> CSS: For styling and creating a visually appealing user interface.
> JavaScript: For implementing the password generation logic and handling user interactions.
> GitHub: for hosting.
> ChatGPT: for prompt engineering.
